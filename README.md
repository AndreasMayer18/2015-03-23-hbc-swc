Materials for R session HBC software carpentry workshop

This repository contains the files required for the **Intro to R** session being held as part of the [Software Carpentry workshop at HMS](http://iglpdc.github.io/2015-03-23-hsph/).

The data provided represent results from an RNA-Seq experiment done in mouse. The metadata file can be found in `/meta` and describes the samples. In the `/data` directory there are three data matrices for use: count data, annotated counts (includes gene names), and RPKM matrix.
